Introduction

Prognostics and health management (PHM) is a critical area in industry, focused on predicting the condition of assets to prevent downtime and failures. This dataset, available on Kaggle, is a well-known public resource originally developed by NASA for asset degradation modeling. It contains run-to-failure simulated data for turbofan jet engines, providing valuable insights for predictive maintenance applications.
